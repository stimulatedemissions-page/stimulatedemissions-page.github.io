Hello!  

I am a Denver based ‘laserist’ offering production services to artists and event promoters. I understand that lasers add a dimension to a show that audiences love and will often even seek out specifically for the energy and impact they bring.

Founded with passion for music, Stimulated Emissions was created out of love for spectacular light shows. Combining technical expertise with artistic vision, I specialize in working with artists and organizers, bringing a unique and dynamic visual element to performances and gatherings of all sizes.

I understand the power of light to evoke emotion, create atmosphere, and enhance the impact of music. I work closely with my clients to understand their specific needs and goals, developing customized laser light show solutions that exceed expectations.

#### Key Highlights
* **Safety & Compliance** I am a Certified Laser Safety Officer with a valid FDA variance, ensuring all of my equipment and shows meet the highest federal safety standards and regulations. My commitment to safety provides you with confidence and a legal performance every time. 
* **Collaboration:** I believe in the power of collaboration and enjoy working closely with artists, event organizers, and the local community.
* **Small Events to Large Stages:** From intimate parties to large venues, I can work with and add to your existing production.

#### Services
* **Laser Light Show Operation:** I ensure the safe setup and operation of high-powered laser systems.
* **Laser Light Show Design:** I work closely with you to conceptualize and design custom laser shows that perfectly complement your event's atmosphere and music.
* **Timecode Programming:** I can precisely synchronize laser shows with music, video, and other elements using timecode, allowing for planned playback.
