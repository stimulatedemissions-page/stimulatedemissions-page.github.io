Hello!
I am a Denver based 'laserist' offering production services to artists and event promoters. I beleive that lasers add a dimension to a show that audiences love and will sometimes even seek out.

Founded with passion for music, Stimulated Emissions was created to fill a need for high-quality, creative laser light show services in the Denver metro area and beyond. I specialize in working with underground events, parties, and artists, bringing a unique and dynamic visual element to performances and gatherings of all sizes.

I combine technical expertise with artistic vision. I understand the power of light to evoke emotion, create atmosphere, and enhance the impact of music. I work closely with my clients to understand their specific needs and goals, developing customized laser light show solutions that exceed expectations.

#### Key Highlights
* **FDA Variance:** Ensuring all operations comply with the highest safety standards is my priority. Holding a variance from the FDA, I may legally operate laser light show equipment within the United States.
* **Small Events to Large Stages:** From underground parties to large concerts, I have the experience to handle a wide range of events.
* **Collaboration:** I believe in the power of collaboration and enjoy working closely with artists, event organizers, and the local community.
* **Focus on Creativity:** I am committed to pushing the boundaries of laser light show design, creating innovative and visually stunning displays.

#### Services
* **Laser Light Show Operation:** I ensure the safe setup and operation of high-powered laser systems.
* **Laser Light Show Design:** I work closely with you to conceptualize and design custom laser shows that perfectly complement your event's atmosphere and music.
* **Timecode Synchronization:** I can precisely synchronize laser shows with music, video, and other elements using timecode, allowing for planned playback.
* **Artist Collaboration:** I partner with artists to create custom visual experiences for concerts, tours, and music videos.
* **Underground Events & Parties:** I bring a unique and electrifying visual experience to smaller, more intimate gatherings.


At Stimulated Emissions, I am more than just a laser light show company; I am a visual storyteller. I am dedicated to creating unforgettable experiences that leave a lasting impression.
